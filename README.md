# Ray Tracer

This project implements a basic ray tracer in C++ that renders 3D scenes using primary rays. It supports rendering spheres and triangles using the Phong illumination model. The ray tracer processes a scene file describing objects, materials, lights, and camera configuration, and outputs a rendered image.
